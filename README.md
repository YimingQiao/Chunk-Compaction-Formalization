# Data Chunk Compaction in Vectorized Execution


The Supplementary Material of our paper includes three repositories:
1. **Problem formalization and simulation (Current Repository)**
2. [Some Microbenchmarks to compare various compaction strategies](https://github.com/YimingQiao/Chunk-Compaction-in-Vectorized-Execution)
3. [Integrate the Leaning and Logical Compaction into the Duckdb, evaluting the End-to-end performance](https://github.com/YimingQiao/Chunk-Compaction-in-Duckdb)

---



This repository contains the code that we use it to formalize and simulate the compaction problem. 

It contains 
- A Jupyter notebook, which is the main part of this repo.
   - [Problem Formalization](cpt_algorithms.ipynb)
- Three simulation results, generated by the Juypter notebook.
   - `base_stat.json`
   - `long_tuple_stat.json`
   - `pipeline_stat.json`
- Two result pictures:
   - [Simulation Results A](simulation_analysis_partA.pdf)
   - [Simulation Results B](simulation_analysis_partB.pdf)
 
For details, please refer to that jupyter notebook.
