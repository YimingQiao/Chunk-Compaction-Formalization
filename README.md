# Data Chunk Compaction in the Vectorized Execution


The Supplementary Material of our paper includes three repositories:
1. **Problem formalization and simulation (Current Repository)**
2. Some Microbenchmarks to compare various compaction strategies
3. Integrate the Leaning and Logical Compaction into the Duckdb, evaluting the End-to-end performance.

---

This repository contains the code that we use it to formalize and simulate the compaction problem. 

It contains 
- A Jupyter notebook `cpt_algorithms.ipynb`, which is the main part of this repo.
- Three simulation results, generated by the Juypter notebook.
   - `base_stat.json`
   - `long_tuple_stat.json`
   - `pipeline_stat.json`
- Two result pictures:
